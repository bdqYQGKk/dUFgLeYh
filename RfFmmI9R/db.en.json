Захват Одессы идет полным ходом, и Платов принимает в нём активное участие. На самом деле Платов являлся участником операции \"накрытия бандеровцев\", аресты Гоцмана и Норы были инсценированы. Бандитов встречает замаскировавшаяся контрразведка, которая полностью ликвидировала их, конечно не без помощи капитана Лехи Якименко, взявшего целый рейд. Чекану удается бежать от военных. Раненный, он пытается вместе с людьми Академика, Идой и Штехелем сбежать из Одессы, но бандиты убивают его и двух последних, так как не желают находиться в подчинении немецких диверсантов. А между Академиком и людьми Гоцмана происходит перестрелка, в ходе которой майор Кречетов признается взятому им в заложники Гоцману в том, что именно он убил Фиму, Арсенина, именно он стоял за убийством Роди, а также в том, что он всегда ненавидел Советскую власть, что она всем жизнь испортила. \"Вы все время воюете, а когда не воюете, друг друга убиваете, чужое делите\". На какое-то мгновение Кречетов останавливает перестрелку и выходит с Гоцманом. Освободившийся Давид сбрасывается вместе с Академиком с большой высоты и выживает, приговаривая: \"Извиняйте, если шо не так\". Майор, также, выживает и его уводят.

Break tells Sharon that there's a rumor about Oz being the reincarnation of Jack, and he also tells her they may have to reconsider the Baskerville's true intentions. Gil, Oz, Alice, and Oscar return to Oz's home and at dinner Oscar reveals that before Oz's father disappeared, he signed a contract with a Chain called Gryphon, which turns out to be the same Chain that dragged Oz into the Abyss. Oz locks himself in his room, and when Alice and Gil come, Oz questions who he is and Alice says that's the reason they're working together - to find out who they are. Oz wants to see his father again and Gil finds out that the Baskervilles are staying in Sabrie. On the way there, Oz says that everything he has done so far may have been wrong. When they reach Sabrie, the group finds the Baskervilles and Gryphon. The four almost get dragged into the Abyss, but Oz unleashes B. Rabbit's powers on his own, and they both make the Gryphon disappear. Oz tells his father that he will continue to be himself no matter what happens and no matter what others think of him.
